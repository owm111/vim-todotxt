$ section Introduction vim-todotxt-introduction

vim-todotxt is a plugin that provides syntax defintions, filetype declarations, and some basic functions and commands for working with todo.txt files.

Note that priorities are only defined as uppercase letters in parenthesis at the start of a line (i.e. `^[[A-Z]]`).

$ subsection Recommended setup vim-todotxt-recommended

By default, no keys are mapped. To map the most "important" commands, add this somewhere in your Vim config: >
    nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>x :TodotxtToggleDo<CR>
    vnoremap <buffer> <localleader>x :TodotxtToggleDo<CR>
    nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>p :TodotxtInputMaybePri<CR>
    vnoremap <buffer> <localleader>p :TodotxtInputMaybePri<CR>
<

This setup will have <localleader>x toggle the current line as done and <localleader>p will set the priority of the current line.

Note that you will want to only map these keys for the todotxt filetype. This can be achieved with the |ftplugin| folder or |autocommands|.

$ section Syntax vim-todotxt-syntax

The following highlight groups are defined for todo.txt files (filetype "todotxt"):

$ syntax syntax/todotxt.vim

todotxtPri{letter}            Tasks of priority {letter}.
